// do clearing support
// change from "New" to something else
// more dn work, e.g. deltaNeutralValidation
// add a "newAPI" signature
// probably should not send F..A position updates to listeners, at least not to API; also probably not send FX positions; or maybe we should support that?; filter out models or include it
// finish or remove strat panel
// check all ps
// must allow normal summary and ledger at the same time
// you could create an enum for normal account events and pass segment as a separate field
// check pacing violation
// newticktype should break into price, size, and string?
// give "already subscribed" message if appropriate

// BUGS
// When API sends multiple snapshot requests, TWS sends error "Snapshot exceeds 100/sec" even when it doesn't
// When API requests SSF contracts, TWS sends both dividend protected and non-dividend protected contracts. They are indistinguishable except for having different conids.
// Fundamentals financial summary works from TWS but not from API
// When requesting fundamental data for IBM, the data is returned but also an error
// The "Request option computation" method seems to have no effect; no data is ever returned
// When an order is submitted with the "End time" field, it seems to be ignored; it is not submitted but also no error is returned to API.
// Most error messages from TWS contain the class name where the error occurred which gets garbled to gibberish during obfuscation; the class names should be removed from the error message
// If you exercise option from API after 4:30, TWS pops up a message; TWS should never popup a message due to an API request
// TWS did not desubscribe option vol computation after API disconnect
// Several error message are misleading or completely wrong, such as when upperRange field is < lowerRange
// Submit a child stop with no stop price; you get no error, no rejection
// When a child order is transmitted with a different contract than the parent but no hedge params it sort of works but not really, e.g. contract does not display at TWS, but order is working
// Switch between frozen and real-time quotes is broken; e.g.: request frozen quotes, then realtime, then request option market data; you don't get bid/ask; request frozen, then an option; you don't get anything
// TWS pops up mkt data warning message in response to api order

// API/TWS Changes
// we should add underConid for sec def request sent API to TWS so option chains can be requested properly
// reqContractDetails needs primary exchange, currently only takes currency which is wrong; all requests taking Contract should be updated
// reqMktDepth and reqContractDetails does not take primary exchange but it needs to; ideally we could also pass underConid in request
// scanner results should return primary exchange
// the check margin does not give nearly as much info as in TWS
// need clear way to distinguish between order reject and warning

// API Improvements
// add logging support
// we need to add dividendProt field to contract description
// smart live orders should be getting primary exchange sent down

// TWS changes
// TWS sends acct update time after every value; not necessary
// support stop price for trailing stop order (currently only for trailing stop-limit)
// let TWS come with 127.0.0.1 enabled, same is IBG
// we should default to auto-updating client zero with new trades and open orders

// NOTES TO USERS
// you can get all orders and trades by setting "master id" in the TWS API config
// reqManagedAccts() is not needed because managed accounts are sent down on login
// TickType.LAST_TIME comes for all top mkt data requests
// all option ticker requests trigger option model calc and response
// DEV: All Box layouts have max size same as pref size; but center border layout ignores this
// DEV: Box layout grows items proportionally to the difference between max and pref sizes, and never more than max size

//TWS sends error "Snapshot exceeds 100/sec" even when it doesn't; maybe try flush? or maybe send 100 then pause 1 second? this will take forever; i think the limit needs to be increased

//req open orders can only be done by client 0 it seems; give a message
//somehow group is defaulting to EqualQuantity if not set; seems wrong
//i frequently see order canceled - reason: with no text
//Missing or invalid NonGuaranteed value. error should be split into two messages
//Rejected API order is downloaded as Inactive open order; rejected orders should never be sen
//Submitting an initial stop price for trailing stop orders is supported only for trailing stop-limit orders; should be supported for plain trailing stop orders as well
//EMsgReqOptCalcPrice probably doesn't work since mkt data code was re-enabled
//barrier price for trail stop lmt orders why not for trail stop too?
//All API orders default to "All" for F; that's not good
